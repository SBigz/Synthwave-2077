## When Cyberpunk 2077 meets Synthwave '84

* "Cyberpunk 2077" is a role-playing game developed by CD Projekt Red, set in the futuristic, dystopian Night City. The game's theme revolves around a cyberpunk aesthetic, featuring advanced technology, neon lights, and a gritty urban environment.
* ["Synthwave '84"](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode) is a famous and amazing Visual Studio Code theme, created by [robbOwen](https://github.com/robb0wen) and inspired by the synthwave music genre and the retro-futuristic art style of the 1980s.
* This theme features bright neon colors, reminiscent of the '80s, and fits well with the [Cyberpunk 2077](https://github.com/carlos18mz/Cyberpunk-2077-rebuild) aesthetic Visual Studio Code theme created by [carlos18mz](https://github.com/carlos18mz).
