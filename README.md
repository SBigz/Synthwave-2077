## When Cyberpunk 2077 meets Synthwave '84 ü¶æ

Get ready to dive into a futuristic, dystopian world with the "Synthwave '2077" VS Code theme, where Cyberpunk 2077 meets ["Synthwave '84"](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode). Cyberpunk 2077, a popular role-playing game developed by CD Projekt Red, inspires the theme's design with its advanced technology, neon lights, and gritty urban environment. Synthwave '84, a fantastic VS Code theme created by [robbOwen](https://github.com/robb0wen) sets the theme's mood with its retro-futuristic art style and synthwave music genre inspiration.
